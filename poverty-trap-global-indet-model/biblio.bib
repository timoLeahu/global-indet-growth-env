These individual decisions lead to a dynamic externality for the evolution of the system. However, the impact of an individual and competitive agent is negligible and thus each agent considers this evolution as exogenous data. This leads, assuming rational expectations (perfect foresight due to the deterministic set up), to motions in the three dimensional space of state, costate and externality. Considering the fact that such externalities are widespread, e.g., R\&D in the literature on new growth theory, pollution in environmental economics, etc., the incorporation of such externalities due to competitive markets is important, yet this incorporation may alter the stability of the system. Indeed, complex policies such as stable limit cycles are sustainable in such a low-dimensional economy, even for a separable and strictly concave model.},

The dynamics of our model admits a locally attracting stationary state P1⁎, which is, in fact, a poverty trap, coexisting with another stationary state P2⁎ possessing saddle-point stability. Global dynamical analysis shows that, under some conditions on the parameters, if the initial values of the state variables are close enough to the coordinates of P1⁎, then there exists a continuum of equilibrium trajectories approaching P1⁎ and one trajectory approaching P2⁎. Therefore, our model exhibits global indeterminacy, since either P1⁎ or P2⁎ can be selected according to agent expectations. Moreover, we prove that conditions guaranteeing the attractivity of P1⁎ also imply the saddle-point stability of P2⁎. However, when P1⁎ is not attractive, numerical simulations show the possible existence of one or two limit cycles: an attractive one surrounding P1⁎ and one endowed with a two-dimensional stable manifold surrounding P2⁎.},

Our condition is easy to check in practice and it allows for equilibria to be indeterminate, even when demand and supply curves have the standard slopes.

	abstract = {This paper examines the effects of environmental taxation on long-run growth in an infinitely lived representative agent model of endogenous growth with negative pollution externalities. The novelty of this paper lies in its investigation of how the long-run effects of environmental taxes are affected by the possible emergence of indeterminacy of equilibria in Romer's [1986. Increasing returns and long-run growth. Journal of Political Economy 94, 1002–1037] learning-by-doing model with endogenous labor supply. The analysis shows that environmental taxation generally enhances (harms) long-run growth when the balanced growth path is indeterminate (determinate).},

	abstract = {Natural resources, by their nature, are not readily bent to the status of private property. Efficient resource use is complicated by jurisdictional externalities, public goods, non-use values, and beneficiaries spatially separated from the location of resources. The task is made more challenging by ecological complexity that obscures cause (benefits) and effects (costs), and dramatic time lags between individual actions and subsequent social consequences that, together with substantial uncertainty, introduce the chance of irreversibilities. Resource economists have played a major role in the literature on externalities, the development of individual transferable quotas, non-market valuation techniques and common property management.},

	abstract = {We introduce a renewable resource sector into an endogenous growth model of a small economy, deriving the transitional dynamic equilibrium. The model generates a long-run equilibrium in which a resource sector of limited size can coexist with constant ongoing growth elsewhere. The key feature of the model is the allocation of labor between harvesting the resource and its use in the final output sector. This naturally generates the empirically observed negative relationship between resource abundance and growth. We examine both the dynamic and long-run responses of the economy to various shocks pertaining to technological production conditions and resource sector parameters.},

(1998) “The Simple, Economics of Easter Island: a Ricardo–Malthus Model of Renewable Resource Use”. American Economic Review, 88 (1) 119–138.] started a sequence of papers which sought to deduce from historical and archaeological studies some stylized links between ecological and economic systems. In this strand of literature all the services of the natural environment are aggregated in an ecological complex which is characterized by a simple logistic dynamics. Given such assumptions, these models show a unique long-term steady state. The aim of this paper is to obtain a more general framework that could account for the heterogeneity of environmental development paths followed by past societies. Two new assumptions are introduced: i) the disaggregation of the ecological complex into two different resources; ii) irreversibility — namely, an inexorable tendency to exhaustion when the renewable resource stock is below a certain threshold. Analysis of the dynamic properties of the system shows a multiplicity of steady states which makes it possible to consider the effects of technical progress, cultural and climate changes on the resilience of the existing development path.},
